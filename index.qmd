# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Practical Python Programming for Life Scientists! This book is designed for biology and life science students with little to no prior coding experience. Rather than aiming to make you Python experts, the goal is to help you develop fundamental programming concepts and data analysis skills using Python as a practical tool.

The content progresses from basic syntax through algorithms, functions, classes, error handling, data science applications, and testing methodologies. Each concept is presented with life science examples to show how programming principles can enhance your research capabilities.

This resource serves as an introduction to computational thinking in biological contexts, providing a solid foundation to approach scientific questions from a programming perspective and to effectively incorporate data analysis using Python into your research workflow.

_Note:  This book is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with student feedback. Some sections may still be in development, with the main chapters expected to be finished by May 2025._
