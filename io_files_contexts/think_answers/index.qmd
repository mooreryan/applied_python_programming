# Stop & Think Answers â€” @sec-io-files-contexts

@tip-09-missing-data: This file no longer included `Hello, this is my first file!` because the write mode (`"w"`) will overwrite the contents of existing files by default.

@tip-09-improving-error-messages: You could include the name of the file that caused the error.

@tip-09-parse-fasta-fastq: It won't work correctly! At the time of writing this chapter, biopython gives a warning about the file format.

@tip-09-csv-no-header: If the `fieldnames` argument is omitted, the values in the first row of the file will be used as the field names and will be omitted from the results.
